mPower project

Project checkout:
The project must be checked out to a directory so that the SEGGER project file is
  ../../../../../../../
relative in the nRF52-SDK_15.0.0 base folder.
If the nRF52_SDK_15.0.0 is installed to C:\nRF52_SDK_15.0, the project 
should be checked out to i.e. C:\nRF52_SDK_15.0\projects\nrf\c\mPower.
The SEGGER project file will then be located at 
  C:\nRF5_SDK_15.0\projects\nrf\c\mPower\pca10040\s132\ses\mPower.emProject
